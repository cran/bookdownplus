\description{
Technically, \code{bookdownplus} is a collection and selector of R bookdown templates. \code{bookdownplus} helps you write academic journal articles, guitar books, chemical equations, mails, calendars, and diaries. R \code{bookdownplus} extends the features of \code{bookdown}, and simplifies the procedure. Users only have to choose a template, clarify the book title and author name, and then focus on writing the text. No need to struggle in YAML and LaTeX.

Full documentation of \code{bookdownplus} can be found in the book \href{https://bookdown.org/baydap/bookdownplus}{R bookdownplus Textbook}. Here is a quick-start procedure.
\itemize{
\item Before starting, you have to install \code{bookdown} package, and other software and packages (i.e. 'Pandoc', 'LaTeX', \code{rmarkdown}, \code{rticle}, \code{knitr}, etc.) which \code{bookdown} depends on. See the \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/}{official manual of bookdown} for details. Additionally, if you want to produce a poster, phython must be installed before using, and the path of phython might have to be added to the environmental variables for Windows users.
\item Run \code{bookdownplus()} and specify the template with \code{template} argument, You will get some files (e.g. \code{index.Rmd}, \code{body.Rmd}, \code{bookdownplus.Rproj}) and folders in your working directory. Although there are many other arguments for \code{bookdownplus()}, you can simply ignore them if you use \code{bookdownplus} package for the first time.
\item Open \code{bookdownplus.Rproj} with RStudio. Now press \code{ctrl+shift+b} to build it. Your will get a book file named \code{*.pdf} in \code{_book/} folder.
\item Write your own text in \code{index.Rmd} and \code{body.Rmd}, and build your own lovely book.
